      <h2>About Prep & Preserve</h2>
      <p>
        This app is named Prep & Preserve for a few reasons. First, I'm a fan of
        alliteration, but the name also reflects the way I like to cook. “Prep”
        comes from the culinary term <em>mise en place</em>, a French phrase
        meaning “everything in its place,” which refers to gathering, preparing,
        and organizing all your ingredients and tools before you start cooking.
        “Preserve” speaks to the other core purpose of the app: storing and
        keeping the recipes you love so they're always at hand when you want to
        make them again.
